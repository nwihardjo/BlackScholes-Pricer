    "\n",
    "**UnderlyingMarket**: this spits out new spot values at regular intervals and also at the same time updates the quote of the single option that is trading.\n",
    "\n",
    "**MarketMaker**: this is a market maker that uses your model trying to stay in the market. That means he is listening to spot updates, calls your model to calculate a new price for the option and then publishes the price to the market. The price should be between the bid and ask price, otherwise you give a way arbitrage and loose money. There can be more than one MarketMaker in the game.\n",
